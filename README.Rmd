# AZMP_climatology

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of AZMP_climatology is to generate a monthly climatology product
for the Scotian Shelf. This product will be used to update the QC methodology 
used at Bedford Institute of Oceanography to quality control bottle data from
our long term monitoring programs. 

The current QC system compares bottle data to a monthly climatology which was 
generated in 2014 by Gordana Lazin, Andrew Cogswell, Catherine Johnson, 
Shelley Bond and Jeff Jackson (unpublished). This climatology makes some small 
improvements in data quality and parameter coverage. It also updates the dataset
to a more relevant time period.
